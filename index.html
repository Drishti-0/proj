        <ul>
           <b><li>He never failed in math. This is a populf "fact" promoted on the internet,maybe in an attempt tolate genius. However,it is simple not true. Overal,Einstein was an average student,but math was one area where he excelled,unsprisingly.</li></b>
           <b><li>Einstein encouraged the devlopment of nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted,with some claming that he helped create the atom bomb.In reality,what he did was write a letter to president FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon,which led to the Manhattan Project.Althrough a dedicated pacifist and,later,an anti-nuke spokesman,Einsteinwas convinced that america needed the atomic bomb before the nazis.</li></b>
           <b><li>He was  great musician.If the whole "genius" thing didn't wor out,Einstei couldhave become a violinist. His mother played piano  so he had the love of music instilled in him-via violin lessons-at the young age of Five.</li></b>

           <b><li>His brain was stolen. Ater Einstein died,the pathologist eho did his autopsy took his brain withouth permission .
